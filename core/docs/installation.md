## Install Workspace

Before installing workspace you will need to make sure you have the minimum <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/deployment#server-requirements" target="_blank">server requirements</a> and then you'll want to clone the repo to your machine.

### Clone the Repo

You can clone the repo onto your local machine with the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/dev-giri/workspace.git project_name
```

Change `project_name` with the name of your project. Optionally, you may want to create a [new Github Repo for your project](#create-repo).

---

Ok, now we can easily install Workspace with these **4 simple steps**:

### 1. Create a New Database

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a new database and save the credentials for the next step.

### 2. Copy the `.env.example` file

We need to specify our Environment variables for our application. You will see a file named `.env.example`, you will need to duplicate that file and rename it to `.env`.

Then, open up the `.env` file and update your *DB_DATABASE*, *DB_USERNAME*, and *DB_PASSWORD* in the appropriate fields. You will also want to update the *APP_URL* to the URL of your application.

```bash
APP_URL=http://workspace.test

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=workspace_super
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```


### 3. Add Composer Dependencies

Next, we will need to install all our composer dependencies by running the following command:

```php
composer install
```
### 4. Run Migrations and Seeds

We need to migrate our database structure into our database, which we can do by running:

```php
php artisan migrate
```
<br>
Finally, we will need to seed our database with the following command:

```php
php artisan db:seed
```
<br>

ðŸŽ‰ And that's it! You will now be able to visit your URL and see your Workspace application up and running.


> For security measures you may want to regenerate your application key, be sure to run the following command below to secure your site before going live.

```php
php artisan key:generate
```

## Create a New Repo

In most cases it's a good idea to create a separate repo for your new project. This will also make it easier to [deploy our application to DigitalOcean](#deploy-to-do).

If you are logged into your Github account, you can go to <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">https://github.com/new</a> to create a new repository. Give it a name associated with your SAAS and click **Create Repository**


After you click on create repo, you will need to open up the command line and `cd` into your `project_name` folder and run the following commands, replacing `tnylea/project_name` with the name of your repo:

```
rm -rf .git/
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "first commit for my SAAS"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/tnylea/project_name.git
git push -u origin main
```

If you refresh your Github Repository you should see that it now contains the files for your new SAAS application.
